## Introduction
Collagen peptide supplementation offers a variety of benefits for human health. For instance, it supports skin health by improving hydration, elasticity, and reducing wrinkles. Additionally, it has been shown to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, while enhancing lean body mass, indicating potential cardiovascular benefits. Collagen peptides also mitigate muscle soreness and fatigue in middle-aged adults post-exercise. These effects underscore the therapeutic potential of collagen peptides in preventive medicine, particularly for aging populations and those at risk of cardiovascular diseases.
