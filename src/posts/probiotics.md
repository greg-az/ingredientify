# Benefits of Probiotics

The health benefits of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, which include various strains like Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, are well-documented. These probiotics are known to improve gut health and boost the immune system. Specifically, they have been associated with the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders, enhancement of the immune response, and potential reduction in the risk of certain cancers ([Safarkar & Alikhiavi, 2023](https://typeset.io/papers/a-review-on-the-effect-of-lactobacillus-and-bifidobacterium-probiotics-4jfa); [Rahimi & Himmat, 2022](https://typeset.io/papers/probiotics-and-health-benefits-5ftu)). Additionally, certain strains are linked to specific health outcomes, such as the prevention of kidney stones and the management of hypercholesterolemia ([Khoshnood et al., 2023](https://typeset.io/papers/potential-role-of-lactobacillus-and-bifidobacterium-for-preventing-kidney-stones-3jtu); [Marras et al., 2021](https://typeset.io/papers/the-role-of-bifidobacteria-in-predictive-and-preventive-medicine-9eu4)).
