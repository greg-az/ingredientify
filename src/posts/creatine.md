# Intro

Creatine monohydrate is a popular supplement recognized for its numerous health and performance benefits. It enhances physical performance by increasing energy availability during high-intensity, short-duration exercises ([Kreider & Stout, 2021](https://typeset.io/papers/creatine-in-health-and-disease-3x0fk4t8kc)). Creatine is also explored for its potential therapeutic benefits in conditions like muscle and bone diseases, and metabolic disorders due to its role in cellular energy metabolism ([Kreider & Stout, 2022](https://typeset.io/papers/creatine-supplementation-for-health-and-clinical-diseases-9ws65pw1)). Moreover, it may benefit cognitive functions, particularly in aging populations by enhancing memory and neuronal activity ([Prokopidis et al., 2022](https://typeset.io/papers/945-effectiveness-of-creatine-supplementation-on-memory-in-1ofoqkhs)). Additionally, studies suggest it does not adversely affect kidney function when used responsibly ([Baldin et al., 2021](https://typeset.io/papers/efeitos-da-suplementacao-cronica-da-creatina-sobre-a-funcao-532084er4h)).
